# Project Manager
This repository contains the source code for a project tracking tool that I use to track my various projects (Freelance Jobs, Bukkit Plugins, etc.). The program is written in Java using Swing. It has been tested on MacOS, Windows and Linux. This program is currently pretty basic, but I welcome pull requests and will also be adding new features over time as well. 

I hope to eventually begin polishing the program and give it a more professional look and feel.
