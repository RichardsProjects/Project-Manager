# Project Tracker
This repository contains the source code for a project tracking tool that I use to track my various projects (Freelance Jobs, Bukkit Plugins, etc.). The program is written in Java using Swing. So far I have only tested it on Windows. I do not know how it will run on Linux or Mac OS X. There are a few basic features this software currently includes. The ability to add a new project, add time sessions and income transactions to projects, the option to set the status of a project (in progress, priority, or completed), and the ability to sort projects by their status. 


It is provided with no guarantee that it will be useful, but with the hope that people will find a use for it. Right now I am currently just expanding the functionality of it and adding new features, however after these things are done I will begin polishing the software, improving the UI and creating an options menu. I also don't have a name for it yet. So please feel free to post any suggestions!
